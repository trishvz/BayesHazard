the full and null Stan models and fit those models to simulated data.  Any

To run the full analysis for the 3-condition capacity coefficient study
(Study 1), simply execute the file batch.sh.  The computer is assumed to be
a linux machine running R with all necessary libraries (see the code for
more information).  If the code is modified for use on other systems (e.g.,
Mac or PC), please make it available as we have made our code available.
