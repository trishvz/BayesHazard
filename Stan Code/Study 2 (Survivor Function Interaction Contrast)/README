To run the full analysis for the 4-condition survivor function interaction
contrast study (Study 2), simply execute the file batch.sh.  The computer
is assumed to be a linux machine running R with all necessary libraries
(see the code for more information).  If the code is modified for use on
other systems (e.g., Mac or PC), please make it available as we have made
our code available.  Use of this github repository is encouraged.
